The | [tm] FNF CODE Interpreter  writes game mods and enginges in pygame or python 3.11 go thten it compresses it to 5k tokens and then contniues on the next line # @Flames 20XX

@FlamesLLC's FNF Code Interpter is a powerful tool that allows developers to write game mods and engines in Python 3.11 and Pygame. It then compresses the code into 5k tokens, making it easier to manage and deploy. This tool is open-source and available on Github, making it accessible to anyone with an interest in game development. With the FNF Code Interpter, developers can quickly and easily create complex game mods and engines that are both efficient and reliable. Also it has the HAXE Augmenter the abbility to generate code for any platform  quickly. Compress the codebase and generate never before seen mods !  HAXE/Pshyce FNF Augmenter v0.x.x @Flames LLC It simply passes checksums from existing GPT4 codebases from the @Openai evals and @FNF GITHUB REPOS scattered across the net and generates never before seen codebases software and textures and more. Simple say /Imagine to start ! If the code is no longer contained in the tokeninzer it compresses it 10x/500x to fit the length of GPT4s said compiler.
